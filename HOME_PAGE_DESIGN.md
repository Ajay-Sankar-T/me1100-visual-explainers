# ME1100 VISUAL EXPLAINERS — HOME PAGE DESIGN
## The Learning Control Panel North Star

> This is not a landing page.  
> This is a learning control panel for a first-year engineering student.

## 🎯 PRIMARY GOALS

✅ Instantly communicate: "This is Thermodynamics, but visual."  
✅ Student starts learning in ≤ 5 seconds  
✅ Signal seriousness → portfolio-grade quality  
✅ Master Calculator feels central, not an afterthought

## 🟠 SECTION 1: HERO

### Layout
Left: Message  
Right: Animated visual

### Text

**Title (Big, Bold, Memorable):**
```
Thermodynamics,
finally explained visually.
```

**Subtitle:**
```
ME1100 concepts explained with interactive diagrams,
sliders, and calculators — not memorization.
```

**Primary CTA (Accent Orange #FF6B35):**
```
▶ Start Learning
```

**Secondary CTA (Outline Style):**
```
🧮 Open Master Calculator
```

### Hero Visual (CRITICAL)

Animated loop (3–4 seconds):
- PV diagram morphing (volume changes, pressure responds)
- Vapor dome appearing with quality slider moving
- Entropy bar increasing visually
- Cycle loop closing (Otto or Rankine)
- Then repeat

**Requirements:**
- Muted motion (not flashy)
- Physics-meaningful (real thermodynamic relationship)
- Colors match design system
- No audio
- Smooth 60fps

## 🔵 SECTION 2: HOW THIS SITE WORKS

Three cards. One concept each.

### Card 1 — SEE
**Icon:** 👁️  
**Heading:** See  
**Text:** Every concept starts with a diagram.  
**Color Accent:** Blue (#2563EB)

### Card 2 — PLAY
**Icon:** 🎚️  
**Heading:** Play  
**Text:** Change pressure, temperature, volume — see what changes.  
**Color Accent:** Orange (#FF6B35)

### Card 3 — UNDERSTAND
**Icon:** 🧠  
**Heading:** Understand  
**Text:** Equations come after intuition.  
**Color Accent:** Green (#10B981)

**Philosophy Alignment:**  
This section directly supports: **Visual > Text → User Learns by Playing → Engineering-Accurate**

## 🔴 SECTION 3: CORE MODULES GRID

### Grid Layout
2 columns × 4 rows  
Each card clickable & linked  
Standardized card design

### Module Card Design (TEMPLATE)

## 🟢 SECTION 4: MASTER CALCULATOR CALLOUT

### Layout
Wide horizontal card (full width or 90%)  
Prominent positioning  
Feels like a power tool, not a footnote

### Text

**Title (Bold, Large):**
```
Master Thermodynamics Calculator
```

**Subtitle:**
```
Solve ME1100 problems using the same visuals you learn with.
```

### Buttons

**Primary Button (Orange):**
```
▶ Open Calculator
```

**Secondary Button (Outline):**
```
View Supported Calculations
```

### Visual Component
Mini UI preview showing:
- Tab interface (First Law, Entropy, Properties, Cycles, Units)
- PV diagram thumbnail
- Property finder snapshot
- Color-coded calculation outputs

**Style:**
- Screenshot or live demo (your choice)
- Shows 3–5 interactive elements
- Demonstrates "visual + calculator" integration

## 🟣 SECTION 5: HOW TO USE THIS FOR ME1100

### Timeline (Horizontal or Vertical)

```
1️⃣ LEARN THE VISUAL
   Start with the diagram. Move sliders.
   See what happens.
   ↓
2️⃣ PLAY WITH SLIDERS
   Predict the outcome.
   Then check if you were right.
   ↓
3️⃣ READ THE EQUATION
   Now the formula makes sense.
   ↓
4️⃣ USE THE CALCULATOR
   Solve practice problems.
   Verify with Master Calculator.
   ↓
5️⃣ SOLVE EXAM PROBLEMS
   You now have intuition, not just formulas.
```

**Why This Matters:**  
Reasures students how to use the site. Removes ambiguity.

## ✅ QUALITY CHECK (PASS / FAIL)

Before approving the home page, verify:

- [ ] Can a student understand what this is in 5 seconds?
- [ ] Can they start learning without reading instructions?
- [ ] Does this feel like a tool, not notes?
- [ ] Is the Master Calculator positioned as central?
- [ ] Are all 8 modules visible without excessive scrolling?
- [ ] Is the hero animation smooth and physics-meaningful?
- [ ] Do colors follow the design system exactly?
- [ ] Is the typography clean and readable?

**Pass Criteria:** 7/8 or better → Ship  
**Fail Criteria:** Missing critical sections → Redesign

## 🔜 NEXT MOVE

Once the home page is approved:

**Build PropertyFinder & Vapor Dome first**

Because:
- It feeds into 4+ other modules
- Highest exam weight (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- Most visually impactful
- Sets the quality bar for all components

When Comet builds it, review it against this home page design.  
Does it belong? Does it meet the visual bar?  

**Say "1" when ready to review PropertyFinder output.**
